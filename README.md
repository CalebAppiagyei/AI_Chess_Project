# Random_AI
To undo a move press the 'u' key
To reset the board press the 'r' key
A yellow square is a possible move the user can make
A red square was the last move made
This project was created with inspiration from Eddie Sharick on Youtube

This program allows the user to play against the AI. The AI will be choosing
randomly from a list of valid moves.
