# Greedy_AI

To undo a move press the 'u' key
To reset the board press the 'r' key
A yellow square is a possible move the user can make
A red square was the last move made
This project was created with inspiration from Eddie Sharick on Youtube

This program uses an AI that uses a 'greedy' algorithm to make its move
