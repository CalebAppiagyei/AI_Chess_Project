# Chess AI using a MinMax method
Player vs Player chess game
To undo a move press the 'u' key
To reset the board press the 'r' key
A yellow square is a possible move the user can make
A red square was the last move made
This project was created with inspiration from Eddie Sharick on Youtube

This program has a chess AI that uses a MinMax algorithm to make decisions.
The computer attempts to make moves that will give it the best point value.
One program uses MinMax without recursion and the other is MinMax with 
recursion.
